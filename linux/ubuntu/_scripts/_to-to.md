Prompt 1 (Interactive CLI):

Rewrite and enhance the following Python script following the Advanced Terminal Application guidelines. The updated version should feature:

- Professional UI Implementation with a Nord color theme throughout all interface elements
- A fully interactive, menu-driven interface with numbered options and validation
- Dynamic ASCII banner using Pyfiglet with gradient styling that adapts to terminal width
- Rich library integration for panels, tables, spinners, and progress tracking with real-time statistics
- prompt_toolkit integration for tab completion, command history, and enhanced user input
- Comprehensive error handling with color-coded messaging and recovery mechanisms
- Signal handling for graceful termination (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
- Type annotations and dataclasses for improved code readability
- Cross-platform compatibility with appropriate environment detection
- Modular organization with clearly commented sections and separation of concerns

Ensure the script maintains its core functionality while implementing these enhancements for a production-grade, professional user experience. The application should be purely interactive with no command-line argument parsing.

Prompt 2 (Unattended/Automated Script):

Rewrite and enhance the following Python script following the Advanced Terminal Application guidelines for an unattended operation mode. The updated version should:

- Run fully autonomously while maintaining professional terminal output with Nord color theme
- Display a dynamic ASCII banner using Pyfiglet with gradient styling at startup
- Implement Rich library components for enhanced visual feedback:
  - Progress bars with detailed statistics for tracking long-running operations
  - Spinners with descriptive status messages for indeterminate processes
  - Panels and styled text for clear section delineation and results reporting
- Include comprehensive error handling with detailed logging and recovery mechanisms
- Implement robust signal handling for graceful termination in unattended environments
- Organize code with a modular structure and clearly commented sections
- Use type annotations and appropriate data structures for improved maintainability
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility with environment-aware operation
- Implement proper resource management and cleanup procedures

The script should maintain its core functionality while operating completely unattended without requiring user input, providing clear visual feedback about its operation status at all times.
