Prompt 1 (Interactive CLI):

Rewrite and enhance the following Python script following the Advanced Terminal Application guidelines. The updated version should feature:

- Professional UI Implementation with a Nord color theme throughout all interface elements
- A fully interactive, menu-driven interface with numbered options and validation
- Dynamic ASCII banner using Pyfiglet with gradient styling that adapts to terminal width
- Rich library integration for panels, tables, spinners, and progress tracking with real-time statistics
- prompt_toolkit integration for tab completion, command history, and enhanced user input
- Comprehensive error handling with color-coded messaging and recovery mechanisms
- Signal handling for graceful termination (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
- Type annotations and dataclasses for improved code readability
- Cross-platform compatibility with appropriate environment detection
- Modular organization with clearly commented sections and separation of concerns

Ensure the script maintains its core functionality while implementing these enhancements for a production-grade, professional user experience. The application should be purely interactive with no command-line argument parsing. Use prompt_toolkit for any cli input or user prompting if needed and use Rich and Pyfiglet throughout.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt 2 (Unattended/Automated Script):

Rewrite and enhance the following Python script following the Advanced Terminal Application guidelines for an unattended operation mode. The updated version should:

- Run fully autonomously while maintaining professional terminal output with Nord color theme
- Display a dynamic ASCII banner using Pyfiglet with gradient styling at startup
- Implement Rich library components for enhanced visual feedback:
  - Progress bars with detailed statistics for tracking long-running operations
  - Spinners with descriptive status messages for indeterminate processes
  - Panels and styled text for clear section delineation and results reporting
- Include comprehensive error handling with detailed logging and recovery mechanisms
- Implement robust signal handling for graceful termination in unattended environments
- Organize code with a modular structure and clearly commented sections
- Use type annotations and appropriate data structures for improved maintainability
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility with environment-aware operation
- Implement proper resource management and cleanup procedures

The script should maintain its core functionality while operating completely unattended without requiring user input, providing clear visual feedback about its operation status at all times. The application should just run fully unattended with no command-line argument parsing.



Nala commands:

NAME
nala-install - install packages

SYNOPSIS
nala install [--options] PKGS ...

DESCRIPTION
Install works similar to the way it does in apt.
nala takes multiple packages as arguments and will install all of them.

To install a specific version of a package you may use the = sign as below

nala install tmux=3.3a-3~bpo11+1

Nala can also install packages directly from a URL such as:

nala install https://example.org/path/to/pkg.deb



OPTIONS

--purge
Purge any packages that would removed during the transaction.
--debug
Print helpful information for solving issues.
If you're submitting a bug report try running the command again with --debug
and providing the output to the devs, it may be helpful.
--raw-dpkg

Force nala not to format dpkg output.
This disables all formatting and it would look as if you were using apt.
A more indepth explanation for what this switch does,
nala will fork a tty instead of a pty for dpkg.
nala will also not display a progress bar for dpkg with this turned on.
Additionally the language of the output will not be forced into English for this mode.


-d, --download-only

Packages are only retrieved, not unpacked or installed.

-t, --target-release


Set the release in which Nala will install packages from
Example: Install neofetch from the testing repo:

nala install --target-release testing neofetch


--remove-essential

Allow the removal of essential packages.
This is very dangerous, but we thought you should have the option.


--assume-yes, --assume-no

-y, --assume-yes

Automatically select yes for any prompts which may need your input.
If the configuration option assume_yes is true, this switch will
set it back to default behavior

-n, --assume-no

Automatically select no for any prompts which may need your input.

--simple, --no-simple

--simple

Show a more simple and condensed transaction summary.
--no-simple

Show the standard table transatction summary with more information.
This variant is the default




-o, --option


Set options to pass through to apt, nala, or dpkg.

Example:

Force dpkg to install new config files without prompting:

nala install --option Dpkg::Options::="--force-confnew"

Disable scrolling text for nala

nala install --option Nala::scrolling_text="false"

Allow nala to update unauthenticated repositories:

nala install --option* APT::Get::AllowUnauthenticated="true"





-v, --verbose

Disable scrolling text and print extra information

-h, --help

Shows this man page.

--autoremove, --no-autoremove


--autoremove

Automatically remove any packages that are no longer needed.
This variant is the default

--no-autoremove

Do NOT Automatically remove any packages


--update, --no-update


--update

Update the package list before the requested operation.
Example:

nala install --update neofetch
is equivalent to
apt update && apt install neofetch

[Default for: upgrade]

--no-update

Do NOT update the package list before the requested operation.
[Default for: install, remove, purge, autoremove, autopurge]



--install-recommends, --no-install-recommends


--install-recommends

Recommended packages will be installed.
This variant is the default unless changed with the apt config.

--no-install-recommends

Recommended package will NOT be installed.
If this option is selected nala will display the recommended packages that will not be installed.



--install-suggests, --no-install-suggests


--install-suggests

Suggested packages will be installed.
This variant is the default

--no-install-suggests

This variant is the default unless changed with the apt config.
If this option is selected nala will display the suggested packages that will not be installed.



--fix-broken, --no-fix-broken


--fix-broken

Attempts to fix broken packages.
This variant is the default

--no-fix-broken

Stops nala from performing extra checks.
This can result in a broken install!

If you just want to fix broken packages:

nala install --fix-broken
